## About

I’m an engineer passionate about solving operational inefficiencies using AI, particularly in the domains of **language models**, **speech processing**, and **emergency systems**. As a **first-generation college graduate** in Computer Science, I’ve worked across both startup environments and high-impact public services.

Currently, I’m building an open-source **AI-first DBMS and reporting engine** for EMS teams in Sheboygan, WI, with a focus on integrating **LLM-driven agents**, **ASR pipelines**, and **custom AI services** into real-world workflows.
